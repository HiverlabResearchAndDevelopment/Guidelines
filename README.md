# Guidelines

## Project structure
Each project should be self contained in a repository

## Adding a new project

 1. Create a new repository
 2. Push the project files on the repository
 3. Add a short README describing the project and explaining how it works
 4. Add a repository description containing the target platform and a one-liner brief of the project like so:
 ```
 [Unity] Line drawer plugin 
 ```

## Builds and releases

If the project comes with a build, do either of the following:
 1. Create a release on the repository
 2. Include in the README the server directory of the build
